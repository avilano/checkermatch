## Checker Match
#### Checkerboard color match challenge

This script uses an 8X8 array and generates random values from 0 to 2 to represent
different colors.

The script then checks for adjacency and gives feedback to the user.


To run this code make sure to have node.js installed:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

 clone this repo and do:

```Javascript
node checkerb.js
```

Feel free to comment or report any bug.

*Note: The ruby and perl ports of the script are still in development.*
